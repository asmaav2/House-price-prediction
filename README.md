# House-price-prediction
This project aims to build an intelligent machine learning model capable of accurately predicting house prices based on historical real-estate data. The model leverages key property attributes such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and overall condition to provide reliable, unbiased price estimations.
